I gladly accepted, excited to help out the class council and at the same time get some work featured for others to see.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/a87961ce4864499090e3a6aab899c8af.jpg\" alt=\"text\"></p>\n<p>There were many different events at the end of the year, so I had fun experimenting with different design styles and elements. Instead of just using a single similar format, I tried to adopt a different style for each design, usually going with whatever came to mind and sticking with it. </p>\n<p>My favorite poster was probably the one for the spikeball tournament, as I was trying to experiment with the style found on <a href=\"https://off---white.com\">Off-White™️</a> clothing—the Helvetica Bold in straight double quotes and stripes. Initially the design was a little more simple, I had used a net as the backgorund, which I also liked but wasn’t completely satisfied with. Instead, I went in a different direction and started with the <span style=\"font-family:helvetica; font-weight:bold;\">“SPIKEBALL TOURNAMENT”</span> and then the rest followed pretty fast.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/3a747a7dcd4647219e4bbd0d0db48630.jpg\" alt=\"text\"></p>\n<p>This year, the class council will be organizing the school’s prom, after-prom, and more. I’m excited to create more posters and continue to experiment with different designs!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Class Council Design Work","date":"March 10, 2020","description":"Graphic design work I completed for my school's class council","thumbnail":"/img/6a8be7e6e82b42f2a09bc26d0be0841c.png"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2020-03-10-class-council-design-work/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2020-03-10-work-for-market-2day/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Work for Market 2day"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2020-03-10-web-design-portfolio/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Web Design Portfolio"}}}}}
