I prefer web design over traditional mobile app design, just because it’s much more flexible in terms of how tons of features can be added without requiring too much work.</p>\n<h2>My portfolio</h2>\n<p>My biggest full-on web design project is probably the website you’re looking at right now, my portfolio. Although it may not seem like art, I consider this to be somewhat of a functional piece of art. I built it from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/CMS Libraries (React, GatsbyJS, and Netlify/NetlifyCMS). I’d always felt like I needed a website, not just to showcase work, but also so that I have something to give people if they ever ask, like an online resumé. One day, an idea for a layout popped up in my head, so I suddenly opened a word processor and started putting together a draft. I was surprised in the end by how accurate the actual site was compared to the static draft.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/portfolio-comparison.png\" alt=\"Porfolio\"></p>\n<h2>Go to Math Textbook Page</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/img/screen-shot-2020-03-12-at-7.27.16-am.png\" alt=\"Go To Math Texbook Page - Website\"></p>\n<p>A friend found a way to use HTML <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string\">query strings</a> to directly navigate to a specific page of the online matn textbook. He implemented this in HTML, and since I wanted to help I did. I was fairly new to web design, so the design is a little sloppy, but I had fun experimenting with CSS color transitions.

Not much is impressive with the website, but I was surprised by how fast I was able to set up this website using a simple template.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/eclo.png\" alt=\"ECLO Consulting Website\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Web Design Portfolio","date":"March 10, 2020","description":"A few of the favorite ","thumbnail":"/img/web-design-cover.png"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2020-03-10-web-design-portfolio/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2020-03-10-class-council-design-work/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Class Council Design Work"}},"next":null}}}
