I helped out with small tasks such as soldering and laser cutting to create demo lights, remade the entrance animation, tore down an exhibition to prepare for a new one, and designed signage while the exhibit was under repair.</p>\n<p>Among the tasks that I accomplished during my time at the gallery, my two favorites ones were probably creating the demo lights and working on the entrance animation.</p>\n<h2>Demo Lights</h2>\n<p>In preparation for the upcoming school year, I was asked to make a complete version of a makeshift demolight that had already previously been produced, which used LED RGBW chips, a LUXDrive FlexBlock, and a few slide potentiometers:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/7cdcfa0d8e4d48d1b0f74c8ceeff970b.png\" alt=\"Parts List\" title=\"Parts List\"></p>\n<p>After having communicated with the studio managers to get an idea of the design they wanted, which was to be 3D-printed, I set off to put together a protype for the lights, beginning with the planning phase:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/db2e33e285e84a79917a3e34e038515f.jpg\" alt=\"The first sketch\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/9367f6ae7b59420eae5b294cd294df49.jpg\" alt=\"The second sketch\"></p>\n<p>And then to create a 3D Model of the product:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/5a41f631c0094f00b8c10ee621ad95bf.png\" alt=\"3D Model\"></p>\n<p>Unfortunately 3D printing turned out to be too expensive, so what we came up with instead was to use layered laser-cut pieces of acrylic locked in place with large threaded wires. After a few more hours of planning and measuring, I was able to figure out a way for the parts to fit, using a modular plate system:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/44ceb630f2f54de3908c03035379014b.png\" alt=\"Pieces\"></p>\n<p>Once assembled, the flashlights worked and to my suprise all of the parts fit perfectly into the laser-cut frame, which gave the product a professional look!</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/c8b5e4a90ede4fe3af24765a42f0a5e1.jpg\" alt=\"Finished Product\"></p>\n<h2>Entrance Animation</h2>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://youtube.com/embed/DhSofC8HDak\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>At the entrance of the studio there is a monitor that displays an animation to show passersby that they were looking into <em>the MIT Museum Studio</em>. Since the monitor was being reconfigured, I was asked to remake the animation for the studio, based on a previous one that played with a text layer in between two sheets of dots, creating an interesting effect. I experimented with scale, rotation and more to create interesting effects for the animation.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"MIT Museum Studio & Compton Gallery","date":"March 10, 2020","description":"Internship at the MIT Museum Studio & Compton Gallery","thumbnail":"/img/b4138f07e0e8476799fe80bc5b9b2a1f.jpg"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2020-03-10-mit-museum-studio-compton-gallery/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2020-03-10-videos-for-school/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Videos for School"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2020-03-10-work-for-market-2day/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Work for Market 2day"}}}}}
