I am part of the [Lexington Legoheads](https://legoheads.tk), a robotics team that participates in the [*FIRST* Tech Challenge](https://firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc). I've been a member of the team for about two years, but in those two years I've learned so much about STEM and design. The program we're a part of is amazing, and I feel like it's prepared my team members and I for college really well.

Since I love design, I managed all of the "design" aspects of the team, notably the rendering of our 3D robot and the layout of the Engineering Notebook. Here are some of the most noteworthy projects I've completed.

## CAD Render

I manage all the rendering and animation. With the help of my digital arts teacher and about 20 tutorials online, I spent about 10 hours figuring out how to use Blender and rendering a robot complete with shaders. I also made a short animation using basic keyframes, which was surprisingly similar to 2D animation software like After Effects.
