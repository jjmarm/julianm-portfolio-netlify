One of my past time hobbies is web design—I like creating page layouts, and then bringing them to life with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I prefer web design over traditional mobile app design, just because it's much more flexible in terms of how tons of features can be added without requiring too much work.

## My portfolio

My biggest full-on web design project is probably the website you're looking at right now, my portfolio. Although it may not seem like art, I consider this to be somewhat of a functional piece of art. I built it from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/CMS Libraries (React, GatsbyJS, and Netlify/NetlifyCMS). I’d always felt like I needed a website, not just to showcase work, but also so that I have something to give people if they ever ask, like an online resumé. One day, an idea for a layout popped up in my head, so I suddenly opened a word processor and started putting together a draft. I was surprised in the end by how accurate the actual site was compared to the static draft.
