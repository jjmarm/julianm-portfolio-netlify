One of my past time hobbies is web design—I like creating page layouts, and then bringing them to life with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I prefer web design over traditional mobile app design, just because it's much more flexible in terms of how tons of features can be added without requiring too much work.

## My portfolio

My biggest full-on web design project is probably the website you're looking at right now, my portfolio. Although it may not seem like art, I consider this to be somewhat of a functional piece of art. I built it from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/CMS Libraries (React, GatsbyJS, and Netlify/NetlifyCMS). I’d always felt like I needed a website, not just to showcase work, but also so that I have something to give people if they ever ask, like an online resumé. One day, an idea for a layout popped up in my head, so I suddenly opened a word processor and started putting together a draft. I was surprised in the end by how accurate the actual site was compared to the static draft.

## Go to Math Textbook Page

A friend found a way to use HTML [query strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) to directly navigate to a specific page of the online matn textbook. He implemented this in HTML, and since I wanted to help I did. I was fairly new to web design, so the design is a little sloppy, but I had fun experimenting with CSS color transitions. Check it out at [math.julianm.tk](http://math.julianm.tk).

## ECLO Consulting

I made a simple [in progress page](http://ecloconsulting.com) for a client who needed to quickly set up an online presence. Not much is impressive with the website, but I was surprised by how fast I was able to set up this website using a simple template.
